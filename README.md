# DOA_Estimation_Methods
 
Contains Direction of Arrival (DOA) Estimation methods for Uniform Linear Arrays as well as Uniform Circular Arrays.

All code written for MATLAB and is purely to understand the algorithms to figure out the DOA estimation of different algorithms. There is no actual antenna research in this
